#beww_experiment

#contains information of the experiment conditions for bleaching every which way runs
#these experiments were conducted at Orpheus Island November - December 2018
#specifically it has hobo logger data and photograph/sampling times for the different experiments
#there are also photos of the corals, which are saved elsewhere to save space
#the photo data are not used in this study
#since these data will be used for other studies, the original full directory including pictures is backed up on coral here: /corral-repl/utexas/tagmap/dixon_backups/bleach_every_which_way
