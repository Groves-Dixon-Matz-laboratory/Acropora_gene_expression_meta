experiment started at 10:40 12-10-18

timepoints (12 pictures per timeoint):
0: forgot and took during treatment  -- 14:40 12-10-18  (4 pictures = 2 treatments X 2 sides; these are taken from above instead of side like all others)
1: 14 hours after start. Fixed here  -- 00:40 12-11-18  (16 pictures = 4 genotypes X 2 treatments [C and T] X 2 sides (1-3 and 3-1); note that N1 was dead but I fixed it anyway)
2: 24 hours after start. Fixed here  -- 11:00 12-11-18  (16 pictures; these samples looked dead more than bleached. Probably not usable)
